*Overall Insights from the Report*:

This is a women's cricket tournament dashboard (a bilateral/multi-nation series with these 8 teams).
India and Australia are the standout teams — highest wins, best net run rate, top batters and bowlers.
Pakistan struggled significantly (0 wins, highest losses, poor NRR).
Balanced team participation (~8–10 matches each → consistent with a single round-robin of 8 teams = 28 matches, but totals suggest possibly full tournament + knockouts or double round elements reaching ~70 matches total, though that seems high for standard ODI WC; perhaps includes women's T20 or a custom league).
Strong emphasis on individual stars from India (Smriti Mandhana, Deepti Sharma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Harmanpreet) and Australia (Ashleigh Gardner, Alana King, Beth Mooney, Annabel Sutherland).
The report is professionally designed with navigation, slicers, AI visuals hints, and branding, suitable for sharing tournament insights or analysis. If this matches a specific real-world event.
